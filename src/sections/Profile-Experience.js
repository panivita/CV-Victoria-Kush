        <p>
          I am an ambitious problem solver with a passion for web-development,
          and I would like to join a team of like-minded developers. I am
          thorough and precise in everything I does, and has a keen interest in
          technology, web-development and user experience. As someone who takes
          responsibility for their own personal development, I am continually
          evaluating and upgrading my skills.
